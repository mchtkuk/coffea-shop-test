        <p>We will build a small game during this tutorial.</p>
        <p>The techniques you’ll learn in the tutorial are fundamental to building any React app, and mastering it will give you a deep understanding of React.</p>
        <p>The tutorial is divided into several sections:</p>
        <li>Overview will teach you the fundamentals of React: components, props, and state.</li>

        <p>In this tutorial, we’ll show how to build an interactive tic-tac-toe game with React.</p>
        <p>One of the features that you’ll notice is that there is a numbered list to the right of the game’s board.</p>
        <p>This list gives you a history of all of the moves that have occurred in the game, and it is updated as the game progresses.</p>
        <li>You can close the tic-tac-toe game once you’re familiar with it.</li>
        <li>We’ll be starting from a simpler template in this tutorial.</li>

        <p>We’ll assume that you have some familiarity with HTML and JavaScript, but you should be able to follow along even if you’re coming from a different programming language.</p>
        <p>We’ll also assume that you’re familiar with programming concepts like functions, objects, arrays, and to a lesser extent, classes.</p>
        <li>If you need to review JavaScript, we recommend reading this guide.</li>
        <li>Note that we’re also using some features from ES6 — a recent version of JavaScript.</li>

      <header>What Is React?</header>
        <p>React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.</p>
        <p>React has a few different kinds of components, but we’ll start with React.Component subclasses:</p>
        <li>We’ll get to the funny XML-like tags soon. We use components to tell React what we want to see on the screen. When our data changes, React will efficiently update and re-render our components.</li>

        <p>If you’re going to work on the tutorial in your browser, open this code in a new tab: Starter Code.</p>
        <p>This Starter Code is the base of what we’re building. We’ve provided the CSS styling so that you only need to focus on learning React and programming the tic-tac-toe game.</p><pre>
        <code>class Board extends React.Component {
            renderSquare(i) {
              return <Square value={i} />;
            }
          }</code></pre><pre>

            render() {
              return (

                button>
              );
            }
          }</code></pre>
        <li>We strongly recommend typing code by hand as you’re working through the tutorial and not using copy/paste. This will help you develop muscle memory and a stronger understanding.</li>

      <header>Making an Interactive Component</header>
        <p>Let’s fill the Square component with an “X” when we click it. First, change the button tag that is returned from the Square component’s render() function to this:</p>
        <p>As a next step, we want the Square component to “remember” that it got clicked, and fill it with an “X” mark. To “remember” things, components use state.</p>

          }
        }</code></pre>
        <li>In JavaScript classes, you need to always call super when defining the constructor of a subclass. All React component classes that have a constructor should start with a super(props) call.</li>

      <header>Developer Tools</header>
        <p>The React Devtools extension for Chrome and Firefox lets you inspect a React component tree with your browser’s developer tools.</p>
        <p>After installing React DevTools, you can right-click on any element on the page, click “Inspect” to open the developer tools, and the React tabs (“⚛️ Components” and “⚛️ Profiler”) will appear as the last tabs to the right. Use “⚛️ Components” to inspect the component tree.</p>
        <p>However, note there are a few extra steps to get it working with CodePen:</p>
        <li>Log in or register and confirm your email (required to prevent spam).Click the “Fork” button.</li>
        <li>Click “Change View” and then choose “Debug mode”.In the new tab that opens, the devtools should now have a React tab.</li>
